## Publish new GitHub Action version

A new GitHub _pre-release_ is created [automatically](./.github/workflows/create-new-pre-release.yml) if there are new changes on the `main` branch. Uncheck _This is a pre-release_ in the _Edit_-Section for a specific pre-release in order to [update](./.github/workflows/release-new-action-version.yml) a major tag (e.g. v1) to point to the latest release. A major tag from the latest released tag is created automatically if a corresponding major tag doesn't exist already.
